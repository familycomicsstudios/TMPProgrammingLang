<h1>Installation Instructions</h1>

To install, first make sure you installed Python (python.org).

Download the files, and extract them into a new folder. Go to the TMP folder, and type in:

python3 tmp.py

To install, use a python compiler.

No batchfile support yet (.tmpc is the extension) but we're working on it!
