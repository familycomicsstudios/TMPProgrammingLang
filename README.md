# TMPProgrammingLang

Programming language made in Python for simplicity and similarity to shell scripting. Head over to Issues if you have bugs, and Discussions if you have suggestions. Try the programming language out!

file extension for batchfiles: .tmpc

current version: v0.5.0-alpha

No stable versions yet, but some usable versions.

Most of these versions are not backwards compatible.


TO PLAY AROUND WITH THIS WITHOUT HAVING PYTHON: Go to Trinket.io, copy the code for tmp.py to your clipboard, and paste it in the code section of the python3 box.
